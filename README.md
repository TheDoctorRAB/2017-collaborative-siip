============

This is a public repository for the shared development of
publications.  Each distinct publication will be generated in a
separate bare branch. The naming convention for branches should be
YYYY-author-keyword-venue where:

YYYY = the year of submission. 
author = the last name of the first author, lower case
keyword = the first word of the title or a distinguishing keyword, lower case
venue = (optional) an identifier for the publication venue, lower case


For example, let's consider the famous publication by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch describing the theory of nuclear fission for the first time (neither scientist would receive the Nobel Prize for this work - their collaborator Otto Hahn was the sole recipient.)  

Meitner, L.; Frisch, O. R. (1939). "Disintegration of Uranium by Neutrons: A New Type of Nuclear Reaction". Nature. 143 (3615): 2. doi:10.1038/143239a0.

Work on this publication would have been in a branch called : 1939-meitner-disintegration-nature .
